# Console log random emoji script for IntelliJ LivePlugin
This is a short script for IntelliJ LivePlugin which inserts a console.log or Console.WriteLine statement (depending on the file extension) with a random emoji.
Currently it inserts console.log for .js, .jsx, .ts and .tsx files and Console.WriteLine for others.

I really liked a similar plugin for VSCode: <https://github.com/jamesformica/emoji-log> and wanted to use similar functionality in Rider.
